# sorghum-meta-QTL
Meta QTL Analysis of Sorghum for Stay Green.  
The R code "Genetic and Physical Intervals of Meta QTLs.R" creates a reproducible circular visualization for my results from the Meta Analysis.
- All the data needed for the plot is located in this github repository. 
- While running the code on your machine, you have to set the working directory (Line 10) to the directory where you have cloned this repository.
- The circular plot produced from the code is also saved in the repository in .svg format.
